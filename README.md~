# pinebook-pro-skin

Vinyl skin for Pinebook Pro laptop lid, intended for use with something like a Cricut Maker.

## Cricut Maker

1. Upload `skin.svg` as an image in the Cricut software.

2. Add the uploaded `skin.svg` as an image in a new project.

3. Ensure the image size is set to 8 inches by 12 inches.

4. Cut it!

5. When applying the vinyl, start in the top-left corner, ensure the left side is lined up, and line up with the bottom-left corner. 

  The vinyl should be just flush with the edge of the lid with no wrap-around, but no aluminum exposed on the surface.
